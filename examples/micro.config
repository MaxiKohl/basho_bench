%% This configuration is intened to benchmark antidote with protocol buffer interface.
%% The important parameters are as follows:
%% not exploit the real throughput of the system, while too high concurrency will over-stress
%% the system and trigger timeouts. The suggested number is about 20.
%%
%% {mode, max|{rate, integer()}}: how frequent a thread should send request. Use 'max' for benchmarking.
%% If you are debugging, maybe {rate, N} can be useful, which means each thread sends N reqs per second.
%%
%% {operations, [payment]}.
%% Current operations: read, append, append_multiple(update nine consecutive keys in a transaction),
%% read_all_write_one(read N consecutive keys and randomly pick one key to update, N is the number of 
%% antidote nodes. The assumption is that each node is assumed to have only one partition and the hash
%% fun should be integer()%N).
%% 
%% to benchmark.
